My project thesis, titled "Dynamic Postural Imaging for Back Pain Sufferers," tackles the prevalent issue of back pain, especially among adults leading sedentary lifestyles. In my thesis, I propose a system that leverages machine learning and computer vision frameworks to assess and enhance users' posture using dynamic postural imaging techniques. This aims to replicate the benefits of Alexander Technique lessons, a method known for its effectiveness in reducing back pain through improved sensory awareness and the correction of maladaptive habits. My system is integrated into an interactive web application, offering visual and auditory feedback to prompt users towards healthier postural habits. I evaluated the system's effectiveness by comparing user behavior with and without feedback, finding a significant reduction in poor posture when feedback is provided.
